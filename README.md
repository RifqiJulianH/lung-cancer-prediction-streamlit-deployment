*Lung Cancer Prediction Model README
**Background
The motivation behind building a predictive model using lung cancer data is to support early detection, diagnosis, and effective treatment of lung cancer patients. Lung cancer is one of the deadliest diseases globally, and early detection is crucial for improving survival rates and patient outcomes.

**Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

To identify the contributing factors behind different levels of lung cancer.
To develop a predictive model for detecting the level of lung cancer in patients based on selected features.
Data and Features
This analysis utilizes a dataset containing various features that may influence the level of lung cancer. Some of these features include:

'Air Pollution'
'Alcohol use'
'Dust Allergy'
'Occupational Hazards'
'Genetic Risk'
'Chronic Lung Disease'
'Balanced Diet'
'Obesity'
'Smoking'
'Passive Smoker'
'Chest Pain'
'Coughing of Blood'
'Fatigue'
'Weight Loss'
'Shortness of Breath'
'Wheezing'
'Swallowing Difficulty'
'Clubbing of Finger Nails'
'Frequent Cold'
'Dry Cough'
'Snoring'

**Model Performance
Upon conducting the analysis, it was determined that predictive models using the Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms exhibited the highest performance. Both models achieved an accuracy score of 0.95, signifying their effectiveness in detecting the level of lung cancer based on the chosen features.

**Model Usage
The predictive model created in this project can be utilized by hospitals and healthcare professionals for early detection of individuals at risk of lung cancer. By employing this model, they can expedite the diagnosis and treatment of potential cases, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and survival rates.
