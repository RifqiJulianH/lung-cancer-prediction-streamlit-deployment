Lung Cancer Prediction Model
Background
Lung cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide, and early detection is crucial to improve patient outcomes and extend their lives. The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using lung cancer data to support early detection, diagnosis, and effective treatment of lung cancer patients.

Objective
The primary goals of this project are:

To identify the factors that contribute to the incidence of lung cancer.
To develop a predictive model to detect the level of lung cancer in patients based on selected features in the analysis.
Data and Features
This analysis utilizes a dataset encompassing various features that may influence the level of lung cancer. Some of these features include:

'Air Pollution'
'Alcohol use'
'Dust Allergy'
'Occupational Hazards'
'Genetic Risk'
'Chronic Lung Disease'
'Balanced Diet'
'Obesity'
'Smoking'
'Passive Smoker'
'Chest Pain'
'Coughing of Blood'
'Fatigue'
'Weight Loss'
'Shortness of Breath'
'Wheezing'
'Swallowing Difficulty'
'Clubbing of Finger Nails'
'Frequent Cold'
'Dry Cough'
'Snoring'
Model Performance
After conducting the analysis, we found that predictive models using the Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms demonstrated the best performance. Both models achieved an accuracy score of 0.95, indicating their effectiveness in detecting the level of lung cancer based on the selected features.

Model Usage
The predictive model developed in this project can be used by hospitals and healthcare professionals for the early detection of patients likely to have lung cancer. By utilizing this model, they can expedite the diagnosis and treatment of positive cases, thereby improving the chances of recovery.
